# HASSL-CLI

HASSL is a language I'm developing that runs in the JVM. This repository provides a way to run HASSL files in zsh.

## Setup

To properly install this tool, just copy the two attatched files, shBox.java and HASSL.sh, into your /usr/local/bin. 

Once this is done, you can run HASSL scripts from a text file by using this command in Terminal:

```
hassl.sh input.txt
```

Where input.txt contains the HASSL script. 

## HASSL documentation

a complete documentation of HASSL, including language details and list of instructions, is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MVJVPbHsg1gpg6RzE6QGUxeaCxMSiigQq8fTcP-2zQQ/edit?usp=sharing
